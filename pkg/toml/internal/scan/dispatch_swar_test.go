// dispatch_swar_test.go is the SWAR row of AC-SIMD-7's dispatch
// enforcement. The build tag mirrors scan_swar.go's tag exactly so this
// file is compiled in every configuration where the *SWAR symbols are
// available — both the vanilla SWAR-only paths and the `force_swar`
// verification path that AC-SIMD-7 mandates at plan line 1056.
//
// The test does NOT call t.Parallel(); it swaps package-level dispatch
// vars and t.Cleanup restores them.

// TestDispatch_SWAR pins every dispatch var to its SWAR variant and
// re-runs the shared smoke fixture through the exported API. This is
// the SWAR row of the AC-SIMD-7 audit matrix.
