// dispatch_arm64_test.go is the arm64 half of AC-SIMD-7's dispatch
// enforcement. NEON is ABI-guaranteed on arm64 so there is only one
// SIMD variant and no host feature gate is needed — the test pins each
// dispatch var to the NEON variant and re-runs the shared smoke fixture
// through the exported API.
//
// The test does NOT call t.Parallel(); it swaps package-level dispatch
// vars and t.Cleanup restores them.

// TestDispatch_ARM64_NEON pins every dispatch var to its NEON variant
// and re-runs the shared smoke fixture through the exported API. This
// is the NEON row of the AC-SIMD-7 audit matrix on arm64.
